# SCT_ML_1
This repository contains my first ML task: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction.
SCT_ML_1 🏠
Machine Learning Project - House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on factors such as:
✔ Square Footage
✔ Number of Bedrooms
✔ Number of Bathrooms

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes real estate listings with various features affecting house prices.

⚙️ Model
The model is trained using Linear Regression.
Features are selected and preprocessed before training.
Performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
📊 Results
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in predicting house prices.

🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-urlhttps://github.com/Prasanth89003/SCT_ML_1.git>
2️⃣ Open the SCT_ML_1.ipynb file in Google Colab.
3️⃣ Run the cells to train and test the model.

📌 Future Improvements
🔹 Experiment with other regression models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).
🔹 Improve feature engineering for better predictions.
